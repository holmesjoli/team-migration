      The monarch butterfly is often used for a simbol of migration, for its trait of freely crossing the borders humans have created. Migration is natural, and humans, too, have migrated from a country to another, from a region to another.

      Although countries have their own laws to grant citizenship to migrants, in 2020, more than 85 million people migrated into another country, according to the <a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/content/international-migrant-stock" target="_blank">United Nations Population Devision</a>.

      On the map below, the butterflies are placed on 21 subregions in the world, and their sizes reflect the number of people who moved migrated there from another region in 2020.
